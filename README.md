# practice creating folders and editing files

My goals within this class are getting more comfortable with
using R studio and GitHub. I also want to learn how to run 
analyses in R for the given questions I'm asking. I want to 
reinforce and expand my understanding of statistics and data modeling.

I think reproducibility is important to me because it is how I can
learn from the work of other researchers. It is one really key way
that I can understand experimental design and analysis in terms
of both why and how something was performed, letting me co-opt or
adapt it for my own purposes. I also think it is important to 
controlling the quality of research, which benefits everyone.
